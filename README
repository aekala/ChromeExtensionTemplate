## Load extension to chrome
Before you can load this extension into Google Chrome, you'll have to enable "Developer mode" by typing in "chrome://extensions/" into the search bar and enabling the setting there. 

Once you have Developer mode enabled, click "Load unpacked" on the "chrome://extensions/" page and load the `dist` directory. You should see your extension now in your extensions toolbar (you may first need to click on your extensions toolbar and pin it before you can see it there).
